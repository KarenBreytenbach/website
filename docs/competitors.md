Passmarked vs. Competitors
==========================

There are many software packages that do parts of what Passmarked does. Most of these packages specialise in one of Passmarked's many categories. There are also generalists that cross over between different categories. In the light of this we will be splitting our competitors into two categories: Generalists and Specialists. 

We take this seriously and therefore this content is [open source](https://github.com/passmarked/website/blob/master/docs/competitors.md) and any discrepancies may be solved by sending us a pull request.

HubSpot's Website Grader
------------------------

Hubspot is a company that does content marketing. They are exceedingly good at it. Customers may sign up to use their platform to facilitate in inbound marketing. The website grader is a tool used to generate leads. It is apparent that the Website Grader only checks for things that will be solved by moving onto the HubSpot platform. 

A clean and easy interface (only accessible after providing your email) shows website owners how their sites can be better. The problem is in the detail. As an example their check for SSL gives you 10/10 by simply having SSL enabled. No matter if you are susceptible to [Poodle](https://poodle.io/), [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com/), [Freak](https://freakattack.com/) or any of the many other SSL vulnerabilites. These are serious and a 10/10 score is questionable.
