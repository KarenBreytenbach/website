Community Driven
================

We believe in the power of the collective. Our rules are open sourced, our scoring system learns by user interaction and our content is written by developers. Passmarked tests are determined and prioritised by developers that are subject experts. Note: we will open source once we launch - we are currently still in Beta.

Industry Standard
=================

Industry standards and best practices are strictly adhered to. Certain tools such as the W3C validator, SSLLabs and Google PageSpeed are considered as standard. We maintain parity with these tools and where allowed by licensing we even wrap them into our tests. This ensures that you only need Passmarked and not a whole toolbelt.

Easy Integration
=================

Continuous Integration
----------------------
We have a full featured REST API with a CLI wrapper making it easy to integrate into your CI environment. With Jenkins and other CI system plugins on their way you may enforce quality standards. Never push out embarassing code again. `npm install passmarked` and there you go!

Content Management
------------------
We have plugins for most major CMS systems including Wordpress and Joomla. This enables us to check every page as soon as it changes in real-time. Be sure that you have no spelling mistakes and that your new content adheres to your great standards! Note: the CMS plugins are still under development and will be open sourced.

Constant Monitoring
===================

We check your site all the time to make sure that things are still ok. We'll notify if we need to. Use this to ensure that your site stays up to date with latest trends, stays free from new security bugs and ensure that new code pushes or deployments do not break anything unexpectedly. Peace of mind.
