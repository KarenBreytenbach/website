Passmarked vs. Competitors
==========================

There are many software packages that do parts of what Passmarked does. Most of these packages specialise in one of Passmarked's many categories. There are also generalists that cross over between different categories. In the light of this we will be splitting our competitors into two categories: Generalists and Specialists. 

We take this seriously and therefore this content is [open source](https://github.com/passmarked/website/blob/master/docs/competitors.md) and any discrepancies may be solved by sending us a pull request.

Generalists
===========

HubSpot's Website Grader
------------------------

Hubspot is a company that does content marketing. They are exceedingly good at it. Customers may sign up to use their platform to facilitate in inbound marketing. The website grader is a tool used by HubSpot to generate sales leads. It is apparent that the Website Grader only checks for things that will be solved by moving onto the HubSpot platform. 

A clean and easy interface (only accessible after providing your email) shows website owners how their sites can be better. The problem is in the detail. As an example their check for SSL gives you 10/10 by simply having SSL enabled. No matter if you are susceptible to [Poodle](https://poodle.io/), [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com/), [Freak](https://freakattack.com/) or any of the many other SSL vulnerabilites. These are serious and a 10/10 score is wrong and leaves the customer with a false sense of security.

DareBoost
---------

Most probably our closest competitor. They offer a free one page test focussing on performance. Their tests are great and useful albeit opinionated. Passmarked focuses on industry standards and the opinions / expertise of all developers. 

Daily monitoring is only available on their premium package. And then only for a very small amount of pages. We find this to be pointless as if and when a serious new issue comes to light our customers want to know about it immediately. The internet changes all the time and it is doing so at an exponential pace. We keep you up to date :)

For a front-end testing platform to be complete, parity with industry tools us a must. Checking *everything* that Google PageSpeed, SSLLabs, W3C etc. checks is non-negotiable. Unless you want to run multiple (and pay for them) platforms at the same time.

silktide
--------

silktide has a tool called nibbler that runs website tests. Most of the tests are great and interesting. The free tool offers a 5 page sample of your site with a limited subset of tests offered by their Pro version. It seems like nibbler is meant as a sales tool to get customers to sign-up for sitebeam which turns out to be the Pro version.

sitebeam focusses montly on your site's marketing function but do extensive tests all round. Then for enterprise there is *another* solution called insight. This author is now giving up for the time being due to general confusion.

Specialists
===========

Specialists will be broken down into our categories where they operate. Most of the following tools are excellent at what they are doing. Some of them are open source and even similated into our product. 

* [SSLLabs](https://www.ssllabs.com/)
* [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/)
* [YSlow](http://yslow.org/)
* [Google Pagespeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/)

These tools test a very particular area extensively. We ensure that Passmarked maintains parity with these tools. This means you may remove them from your toolchain and rely on us as a singular check for them all.

If you find anything you think we should be checking, please contact us and we will happily include it.
