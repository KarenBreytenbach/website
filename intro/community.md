Our Community
=============

Passmarked is a community driven platform. We believe in the power of the collective. To become a platform that sets a standard we need a strong community to adopt it and make it their own. Although we have extensive experience, it pales in comparison to what an entire developer community may offer. Become part of this and help us fix a broken internet! 

Open Source
-----------

All Passmarked rules and content is open sourced. Whenever you use Passmarked and feel that it is missing a test or really need it to check for something that you have identified as a problem, you may simply send us a pull request which we'll merge. Feel free to create a new issue if you want one of our engineers to look at it.

As a Passmarked customer you gain the immense power of other developers around the world adding and tweaking our rules. Any new security issues or performance practices will automatically become part of what we check on your site.

Our Living Score

Our system constantly learns and adjusts its scoring based on how users interact with it. We have an active voting system where you may vote a certain rule up or down influencing its effect on the score. This enables us to score your site based on what developers currently think.
