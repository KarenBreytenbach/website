Our Community
=============

Passmarked is a community driven platform. We believe in the power of the collective. To become a platform that sets a standard we do need everyone to adopt it and make it their own. Although we have extensive experience, it pales in comparison to what an entire developer community will offer. Become part of this and help us fix a broken internet!

Open Source
-----------

We are working hard on open sourcing our tests and rules for our official launch. This is being done so that whenever you use Passmarked and feel that it is missing a test or really need it to check for something that you have identified as a problem, you may simply send us a pull request which we'll merge. We will set up guidelines for this which will follow once we've completed the open sourcing process.

As a Passmarked customer you gain the immense power of other developers around the world adding and tweaking our rules. Any new security issues or performance practices will automatically become part of what we check on your site.

Discussions and Support   
-----------------------

We are running a Slack team where everyone is welcome. If you need to find out about any report result or need advice on how to fix anything please join and ask us. Either us or someone else from our community will assist. Stick around and maybe help someone else in return :) Please click [here for an invite to join our Slack team](https://passmarked.com/slack)

Our Living Score
----------------

Our system constantly learns and adjusts its scoring based on how users interact with it. We have an active voting system where you may vote a certain rule up or down influencing its effect on the score. This enables us to score your site based on what developers currently think.
